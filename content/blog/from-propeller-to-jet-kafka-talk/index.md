## Talk Abstract

Don’t you love signing in to your favorite application only to find out it’s undergoing scheduled maintenance? I know I don’t! Designing scalable systems is a challenge all software engineers face. Ultimately this means you will find yourself in a situation where you need to upgrade your software engines for better performance. In this session, I will guide you through the experience of swapping out PagerDuty’s original prop engine consisting of a Cassandra queue-based system to that of a 747 which utilizes Kafka not only for ingestion of customer data but also internal heuristics and back pressure support.
